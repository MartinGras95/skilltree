skill tree website serves as a way of keeping track of what skills a person has learned.
As of now a user is able to add skills to the tree, mark them as complete and delete them.
a feature that must be added is to be able to toggle between complete and uncomplete.

The data from the website persists using local storage.
A feature that should be added is a notification which lets the user know that data is stored on their local machine.

Future improvements:
A way of branching from skills. 
For example: Branch JavaScript -> React 
The branches would be placed horizontally to the parent skill
